    <h1>Legalize all drugs, a website advocating for drug legalization through empirical reasoning and scientific research.</h1>
    <img src="images/DEA.PNG" alt="Drug Enforcement Administration.">

    <p>The legalization of all drugs may seem like an insane idea to advocate for, but as I will explain, there are numerous benefits that can occur through legalization, and wanting them legalized does not mean anyone can sell or produce drugs. A few of the important reasons and benefits that I will explain in further detail throughout this site are</p>

    <ul> <!-- changed to list in the tutorial -->
      <li>Taxing the large drug market, in turn we could fund drug rehabiliation instead of prison time.</li>
      <li>The war on drugs has not solved any of the issues that drugs cause in society.</li>
      <li>While an opinion, drug users are victims of dealers and or society in itself, and I do not believe victims should be sent to prison.</li>
      <li>Proper facilities and factories could be made for drugs, no more bad cuts such as fentanyl, and if regulated, doses would always be the same, which can (but does not solve) help with accidental overdoses. </li.>
      <li>The reasoning of certain drugs being illegal is not based on any scientific or empirical reasoning, LSD is illegal yet is much safer to the user and people the user may interact with compared to alcohol. </li>
      <li>Safer market for drug users, and the deterioration (but not outright destruction) of the many criminal organizations trafficking drugs into the USA. </li> 
    </ul>

    <p>While I promote the legalization of drugs, I do not advocate for anyone doing any drugs. Moreover, while I do believe that some drugs such as LSD may be beneficial, and that drugs like Marijuana are not inherently addictive, I still do not want to advocate for them as addiction can occur to anything, and when it comes to substances such as LSD I still think more research would be needed before I would feel okay telling others that it is something that they can or should take without worry.</p>

    <p>All contents of this website is written soley by me, Rolando Smith, unless otherwise stated. I will do my best to abstain from any biases or false informstion being posted on this website, but of course I cannot guarantee that they won't ever occur, as I am only human after all! What I will promise though is that I will immediantly remove any biased ideas or misinformation whenever found. Finally, while some pieces will contain opinions (and will be noted as such), I will only be using credible sources that I trust, such as peer-reviewed scientific studies, and I will always cite my information so that anyone can double check any claims I make.</p>
